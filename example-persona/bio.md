## Kicker Notes

The kicker "He was right about that, too" does double duty — it's self-deprecating
(implying nobody believed him) and quietly confident (he was right). The "where he helps"
clause can shift per post to match the topic. The kicker MUST change when it can land
better with a post-specific callback. Propose a kicker and confirm with the author.
