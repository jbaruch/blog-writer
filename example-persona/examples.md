# Example Posts: Baruch Sadogursky / Tessl

The following published posts define the canonical tone. When adding new examples, add them
to this list with a one-line note about what they demonstrate.

## "My Coding Agent Lied to Me (And I Have the Screenshots)"
URL: https://tessl.io/blog/my-coding-agent-lied-to-me-and-i-have-the-screenshots/
Series: Agent Johnson, Episode 1
Key patterns: Opening with collaborator banter, escalating failure narrative, "But wait it
gets better" transitions, AirPointsHelper3000 naming joke, the wink-CTA ending.

## "My Coding Agent Invented an API That Doesn't Exist (And Blamed CORS When It Failed)"
URL: https://tessl.io/blog/my-coding-agent-invented-an-api-that-doesnt-exist-and-blamed-cors-when-it-failed/
Series: Agent Johnson, Episode 2
Key patterns: Callback to previous post, Head First Java extended analogy, constitution/
Continental Congress running joke, Viktor-as-foil dynamic, "tried pure vibecoding before"
continuity, "Which one do you want running in production?" rhetorical closer.

## "My Coding Agent Needed a Package Manager for Its Own Brain (And I Gave It One Using a Skills Registry)"
URL: https://tessl.io/blog/my-coding-agent-needed-a-package-manager-for-its-own-brain-and-i-gave-it-one-using-a-skills-registry/
Series: Agent Johnson, Episode 3
Key patterns: "Three months is a long time in AI tooling" opening, skills-as-package-manager
analogy, the monkey problem (agent skipping failing e2e tests), "vibecoding is fast food /
SDD is a chef's meal" closer from Viktor, intent integrity chain teaser.
Quality note: This post was written with a smaller context window and has sections where the
voice drifts toward industry analyst tone ("The architectural convergence signaled a winning
approach") and events are summarized rather than shown as specific moments. Use it as a
reference for structure and series continuity, but calibrate voice quality against Episodes
1 and 2.
